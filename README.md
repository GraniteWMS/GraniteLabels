# Github basics

The github ecosystem is big and you can setup many things to accomplish what you need from it.
For us the purpose is to have our important 'files' like labels, custom SQL scripts ect. in 
one place and 


## Dont's
- Never copy your GitHub folder (IMPORTANT!!!)
- Never work outside the folder and then replace files inside
- Work on the file in the Github folder 


## Terminology
- Pull (fetch the latest file from GitHub)
- Push (see this as saving a file localy on your machine, it is not yet updated to GitHub)
- Commit (commit will update github)

## Best practices comment
- Comments are important, comment on what you did to the file (the change)
- Prefix the comment with Change, Fix or New
- You do not have to comment the reason behind what you did, or who instructed you to do it
- Keep the comment relevant to the change in the file you made
- Examples
-- Change (add serialnumber to label)
-- Change (remove expirydate)
-- New (new label for Trackingentity )

# Basic Workflow

1. Pull latest before you begin working on any file
2. Make the change on the original file (do not copy and replace files, work on the file in github that is checked out)
3. Push as soon as you done (donâ€™t leave checked out)
4. Add with meaningful comment 
5. Commit straight after you have Push the change
